## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- Vercel CLI (Install globally using npm)
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Vercel:
   - Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) using your GitHub account
   - Log in to Vercel CLI and link your project:
     ```bash
     vercel login
     vercel link
     ```

4. Request the decryption key from the project maintainers - this is required to decrypt environment variables

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the application.
